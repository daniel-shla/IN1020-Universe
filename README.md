# IN1020-Universe (Summer internship 2025)
This project was created during my summer internship at the University of Oslo (UiO) in 2025. It is a digital learning platform built for IN1020: Introduction to Computer Science, a first-year course offered by the Department of Informatics (IFI).

The platform provides a range of interactive exercises, available in both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing students to work individually or collaboratively. In addition, it includes an integrated AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students by answering questions related to the course material.
